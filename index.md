I am a History PhD candidate at [Johns Hopkins University](https://history.jhu.edu/directory/elena-palazzolo/) studying modern United States cultural and social history. The dissertation project, tentatively titled "Making Modern Fare: Labor, Leisure, and American Food Culture in the late-19th Century" examines how American attitudes towards food changed as the nation shifted from producerist towards consumerist ideals. In particular, I am interested in how middling and elite consumers came to overlook labor and environmental concerns in agroindustry and public dining. Narrowing the scope of an otherwise unwieldy set of inquires, I focus on Chicago in the 1890s with an eye to, but not explicit focus on the 1893 World's Fair.  I am also a student of the digital humanities interested in critical, post-colonial, and Black DH with a focus on textual editing, digital design, and pedagogy. Please see the Research and Teaching tabs for additonal information.
