I am a History PhD candidate at [Johns Hopkins University](https://history.jhu.edu/directory/elena-palazzolo/) studying modern United States cultural and social history. Ellie Palazzolo is a PhD candidate in History at Johns Hopkins and incoming Assistant Professor of History and Southern Foodways Alliance Assistant Professor of Southern Studies at the University of Mississippi. Her dissertation, "Modern Fare: Labor, Consumption, and the Rise of the United States Food System, 1886-1906," examines how people engaged in food production, distribution, and service service built alliances, unions, and associations to advocate for rights as workers and as citizens at the same time urban, middle-class consumers grew increasingly ambivalent and occasionally hostile towards workers in food-related trades. The project focuses on Chicago and draws extensively from sources generated around the 1893 World's Fair.
  
Also a student of the digital humanities, I am interested in critical, post-colonial, and Black DH applied to textual editing, sustainable design (minimal computing), and pedagogy.
