I am a History PhD candidate at [Johns Hopkins University](https://history.jhu.edu/directory/elena-palazzolo/) studying modern United States cultural and social history. The dissertation project, tentatively titled "Making Modern Fare: Labor, Leisure, and American Food Culture in the late-19th Century" examines how American attitudes towards food changed as the nation shifted from producerist towards consumerist ideals. In particular, I explore how middling and elite consumers came to overlook labor and environmental concerns in agroindustry and public dining. Narrowing the scope of an otherwise unwieldy set of inquires, the project focuses on Chicago in the 1890s with an eye to the 1893 World's Fair thanks to the huge audience that the event reached and robust body of sources that it spawned.  Also a student of the digital humanities, I am interested in critical, post-colonial, and Black DH applied to textual editing, sustainabile design, and pedagogy.
