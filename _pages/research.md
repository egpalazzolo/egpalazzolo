### The Dissertation



### Earlier Work

#### The First Year Paper

#### Undergraduate Theses

My research in food in the nineteenth-century United States and the Atlantic World began during my time as an undergraduate at the University of Richmond. The honors theses that I completed in History, ["Free French "gentlemen of couleur” : reconsidering race, ethnicity, and migration in Philadelphia's catering industry, 1870-1930"](https://scholarship.richmond.edu/honors-theses/1412/) and French, [“Il est bon, aujourd'hui, le boudin” : la nourriture esthétique et le goût dans le roman naturaliste Zolien](https://scholarship.richmond.edu/honors-theses/1413/), reflect this longstanding interest.
