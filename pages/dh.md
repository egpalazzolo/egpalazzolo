# Digital Humanities  
  
Collaborating with a team of researchers, engineers, DH specialists, graduate and undergraduate students, and community members, I helped to design and build two websites for the project [Keywords for Black Louisiana](https://keywordsforblacklouisiana.org/). The goal of this project is to make transcriptions and translations of eighteenth-century documents from French and Spanish colonial Louisiana available to students, creatives, cultural workers, genealogists, public historians, and academic researchers while highlighting the experiences and stories of Black and African-descended people. We curated one site to highlight [documents](https://docs.k4bl.org) and another to more intentionally narrate [stories](https://stories.k4bl.org). Both sites are built using the principles of minimal computing, centering access, sustainability, security, and usability. This is a [LifexCode: Digital Humanities Against Enclosure](https://lifexcode.org) project supported by the National Historic Preservation and Records Commission and PI-ed by Dr. Jessica Marie Johnson. I joined Keywords at its founding in Fall 2020, and transitioned away from roles as co-Project Manager and Digital Curation Fellow in Fall 2024.  
  
Thanks to my involvement with the "Keywords" project, I have had the opportunity to co-publish "[Kinship and Longing: Keywords for Black Louisiana](https://scholarlyediting.org/issues/41/kinship-and-longing/)" in *Scholarly Editing* (vol. 41) which was my introduction to the Textual Encoding Initiative (TEI). As co-authors, we were able to present our work in a "Digital Dialogue" and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/WBRFbY0uTus?si=xXN3_HeRou3N79Yj).  
  
I co-coordinated the Johns Hopkins DH Workshop from 2022 to 2025.  
  
Digital pedagogy factors into all of my course design. I am currently consulting on the Central Kentucky Slavery Initiative and brainstorming my next digital project. The goal will be to my expertise in textual editing, archiving, and accessible design with my own research interests. More soon!
