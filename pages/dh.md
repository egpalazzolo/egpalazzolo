# Digital Humanities  
  
Collaborating with a fanastic team of researchers, engineers, DH specialists, graduate and undergraduate students, and community members, I helped to design and build two websites for the project [Keywords for Black Louisiana](https://keywordsforblacklouisiana.org/). The goal of this project is to make transcriptions and translations of eighteenth-century documents from French and Spanish colonial Louisiana available to students, creatives, cultural workers, genealogists, public historians, and academic researchers while highlighting the experiences and stories of Black and African-descended people. We curated one site to highlight [documents](https://docs.k4bl.org) and another to more intentionally narrate [stories](https://stories.k4bl.org). Both sites are built using the principles of minimal computing, centering access, sustainability, security, and usability. This is a [LifexCode: Digital Humanities Against Enclosure](https://lifexcode.org) project supported by the National Historic Preservation and Records Commission and PI-ed by Dr. Jessica Marie Johnson. I have been involved with Keywords since its founding in Fall 2020, and will be transitioning away from my roles as co-Project Manager and Digital Curation Fellow in Fall 2024.  
  
Thanks to my involvement with the "Keywords" project, I have had the opportunity to co-publish "[Kinship and Longing: Keywords for Black Louisiana](https://scholarlyediting.org/issues/41/kinship-and-longing/)" in *Scholarly Editing* (vol. 41) which was my introduction to the Textual Encoding Initiative (TEI). As co-authors, we were able to present our work in a "Digital Dialogue" and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/WBRFbY0uTus?si=xXN3_HeRou3N79Yj).  
  
I have co-coordinated the Johns Hopkins DH Workshop since 2022.  
  
Over summer and fall of 2021, I collaborated with Dr. Casey Marina Lurtz on the development of a template for independent research in the humanities and social sciences using ArcGIS StoryMaps. This assignment is accessible regardless of institutional subscription to the ArcGIS. More information on that project is published as "[“History 115: Creating Visually Rich Interactive Historical Narratives with StoryMaps”](https://krieger.jhu.edu/writing-program/projects/history/), and the template itself is available [here](https://teaching-research-storymaps-gisanddata.hub.arcgis.com/).  
  
I am currently in the process of brainstorming my next digital project, and am interested in combining my expertise in textual editing, mapping, and accessible design with my own research interests. More soon!
