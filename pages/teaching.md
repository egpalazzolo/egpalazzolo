Please find below the syllabi for the two courses that I have developed as Instructor of Record. I am happy to share additional resources that I have developed for specific assignments upon request.

[Cookbook Politics: Reading and Writing U.S. Culinary History (Fall 2021)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1085nTHfoA0HWcivAln-rRRxJ-3Z8fumm/view?usp=sharing)  
A six-week, one-credit course developed for the "Student Opportunities in Undergraduate Learning" program at Johns Hopkins.

[Farming America: Food and Power in U.S. History (Fall 2024)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lhrJSAB0iccqM9Tk5j3k5RPL9W3KBJThOT6bi2Vzgpc/edit?usp=sharing)  
A full-semester course supported by a Dean's Teaching Fellowship from the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences.  
  
I am currently in the process of developing syllabi for courses entitled "American Immigration History through Food" and "Engaging Digital Projects."
  
Over summer and fall of 2021, I collaborated with Dr. Casey Marina Lurtz on the development of a template for independent research in the humanities and social sciences using ArcGIS StoryMaps. This assignment is accessible regardless of institutional subscription to the ArcGIS. More information on that project is published as "[“History 115: Creating Visually Rich Interactive Historical Narratives with StoryMaps”](https://krieger.jhu.edu/writing-program/projects/history/), and the template itself is available [here](https://teaching-research-storymaps-gisanddata.hub.arcgis.com/).
