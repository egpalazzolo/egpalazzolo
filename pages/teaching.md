Please find below the syllabi for several of my food studies courses. I am happy to share additional resources that I have created for specific assignments upon request.

Over summer and fall of 2021, I collaborated with Dr. Casey Marina Lurtz on the development of a template for independent research in the humanities and social sciences using ArcGIS StoryMaps. This assignment is accessible regardless of institutional subscription to the ArcGIS suite. More information on that project is published as "[“History 115: Creating Visually Rich Interactive Historical Narratives with StoryMaps,”](https://krieger.jhu.edu/writing-program/projects/history/) and the template itself is available [here](https://teaching-research-storymaps-gisanddata.hub.arcgis.com/). We have an article on the project forthcoming in *The History Teacher* (Winter 2026).
